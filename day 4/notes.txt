146. LRU Cache
________________________
.. Use Least Recently Used Cache {LRU} using Ordered Dictionary in Python
.. Main operations :
  ===================
    put ():-
    ..........
       1.Search for key if found in Dictionary and move to end of Dictionary
       2.Update the value of key in Dictionary
       3.Delete the first element of Dictionary
    get():-
    ...........
       1.Search for key in Dictionary if not found return -1
       2.Move key value pair to end of Dictionary
       3.return the value of existing key value pair in Dictionary

Greedy Approach
________________________
>> At every Stage selecting locally best element is called "GREEDY".
>> Moto of Greedy is locally best choice leads to global optimal solution.
>> There is only decision sequence in Greedy.
>> Greedy is faster but can't produce accurate result.(viz . Dynamic Progrmmaing and Backtracking )
>> It efficiently works with problems like
     . Fractional knapsack
     . Job sequencing with deadline
     . Djikstras Algoritm (Single Source Shortest path)
     . Prims Algorithm (Graphs) , Priority Queue (Min Max heap ), etc..
     . Heaps
     . Algorithms on Graphs
     . Huffman Encoding
>> Find Min or Max is most common concerned questioning pattern in Greedy Problems
